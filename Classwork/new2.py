# For loop examples using range:

# Range with 1 argument goes from 0 through n-1
for num in range(10):
    print (num)

# Range with 2 arguments goes from the first number through the last-1
for num in range(7, 15):
    print (num)

# Range with 3 arguments goes from the first number through the
# second-1, in increments determined by the third number
for num in range(2, 12, 2): # What happens if the 3rd number is negative?
    print (num)


# A while loop example

# Initialize a counter
count = 1
print ("Count is initially", count)
# Want to keep looping until the counter is bigger than 100
while count < 100:
    count = count * 9 
    print ("Now count is", count)

# When we get here, the while loop is done - so count must be > 100
# print "the counter is", count
